Install binary packages in a temporary Cabal sandbox
====================================================



Motivation
----------

A common task to use Cabal for is to install binary packages. In order not to
pollute the global package space, this is often done in a sandbox. This small
script automates this process for packages that support it.

More accurately, the script does the following:

1. Create a temporary directory
2. Initialize a Cabal sandbox
3. Build the desired binaries. Link statically, build with minimal profiling
   overhead (no profiling, no shared libs, no Haddock).
4. Install the binaries to `$HOME/.cabal/bin`
5. Delete temporary directory

Usage
-----

`cabal-install-bin (package)+`



Programs tested with
--------------------

This process does obviously only work for relocatable binaries. The most common
non-relocatable types of binaries are dynamically linked ones and those that
need external data files. That said, many binaries I've installed for myself
over the years were relocatable. Check whether the process worked after
building!

### Successful

Program   | `--version` | package name
----------|-------------|-------------
C2Hsc     | 0.6.4       | c2hsc-0.6.5
Cabal     | 1.22.0.0    | cabal-install-1.22.0.0
GHC Core  | n/a         | ghc-core-0.5.6
HLint     | 1.9.15      | hlint-1.9.15
HsColour  | 1.20        | hscolour-1.20.3
Pandoc    | 1.13.2      | pandoc-1.13.2

### Status unknown

These programs were unsuccessfully built in the past, but due to multiple
patches in the meantime they might work as intended now. I'll gladly take
user reports on success or failure.

Program   | package name  | Problem
----------|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------
Alex      | alex-3.1.4    | (may work, needs testing)
